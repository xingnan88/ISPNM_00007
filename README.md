# ISPNM_00007

This is a repository for the homework assignments of the course ISPNM_00007 - Mathematical Modeling and Algorithm Analysis.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1

The first assignment involves implementing and analyzing two sorting algorithms - bubble sort and quick sort. The performance of these algorithms is compared using different input sizes and types.

### Assignment 2

The second assignment involves implementing and analyzing two graph algorithms - Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). The performance of these algorithms is compared using different types of graphs.

### Assignment 3

The third assignment involves implementing an optimization algorithm - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The algorithm is applied to a benchmark function to find the global minimum.
